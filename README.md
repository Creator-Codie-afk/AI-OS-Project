# AI-OS-Project

A rudimentary AI-enhanced operating system project.

## Overview

The AI-OS project aims to develop a basic operating system with AI-enhanced features. The project includes modules for AI Automation, File Management, Hardware Abstraction, Networking, and User Authentication. Each module provides specific functionality to support the operating system's operations.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Creator-Code-afk/AI-OS-Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd AI-OS-Project
   ```

3. **Set up Docker (optional):**
   Follow the instructions in `DockerSetup.md` to set up Docker for the project.

4. **Install required packages:**
   Refer to `Requirements.md` for a list of required packages and their installation instructions.

## Usage

1. **Run the main modules:**
   Each module has a `main.py` file that can be executed independently. For example, to run the AI Automation module:
   ```bash
   python3 AI_Automation/main.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the modules:**
   The modules provide interactive prompts for testing and demonstration purposes. Follow the prompts to interact with the system.
